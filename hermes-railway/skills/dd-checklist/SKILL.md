# Due Diligence Checklist

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scope the Diligence

Ask the user for:
- **Target project**: Name, sector, location
- **Deal type**: Asset acquisition, equity acquisition, JV, development, carve-out
- **Jurisdiction**: Domestic China, Australia, Hong Kong, cross-border
- **Deal size / complexity**: Determines depth of diligence
- **Key concerns**: Any known issues to prioritize
- **Timeline**: When is LOI / close targeted?

### Step 2: Generate Workstream Checklists

Generate a checklist across all major workstreams, with sector and jurisdiction customization:

**Financial Due Diligence**
- Historical financial statements (3 years)
- Revenue quality and sustainability analysis
- Working capital analysis — normalized vs. actual
- Debt and debt-like items (including off-balance sheet)
- Capital expenditure (maintenance vs. growth)
- Tax structure and exposure
- Pro forma adjustments

**Legal Due Diligence**
- Corporate structure and ownership chain
- Material contracts (customer, supplier, JV, lease)
- Litigation history and pending claims
- IP portfolio and protection (if applicable)
- Regulatory compliance history
- Employment agreements

**Title & Land Due Diligence** (Real Estate / Infrastructure)

| Item | China | Australia |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Title search | 不动产权证, 土地出让合同 | Certificate of Title, Title Search |
| Encumbrances | 抵押登记, 查封, 限制 | Mortgages, caveats, easements, covenants |
| Zoning / Land use | 用地性质, 规划条件 | LEP zoning, SEPP provisions |
| Survey | 勘测定界, 地形图 | Registered survey, lot boundaries |
| Environmental | 环评批复, 污染调查 | Phase 1/2 ESA, contamination assessment |
| Heritage | 文保评估 | CMP, Aboriginal heritage, s170 register |
| Native title | N/A | Native title search, ILUA |

**Planning & Approvals Due Diligence** (Real Estate)

| Item | China | Australia |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Development approval | 建设用地/工程规划许可 | DA / Planning Permit |
| Building approval | 施工许可证 | CC / Building Permit |
| Conditions compliance | 规划验收条件 | DA conditions schedule — which met, which outstanding |
| Planning controls | 控规指标对照 | LEP/DCP/SEPP controls vs. approved scheme |
| Staging approval | 分期批复 | Staged DA / Subdivision certificate |

**Grid & Network Due Diligence** (Energy / Infrastructure)
- Connection agreement status
- GPS (Generator Performance Standards) review stage
- Network capacity and curtailment assessment
- AEMO registration status
- Transmission upgrade requirements and cost allocation

**Technical Due Diligence**
- Engineering / design review
- Equipment specification and sourcing
- Construction methodology and timeline
- Performance guarantees and warranties
- O&M arrangements

**Regulatory & Compliance** (Biosynthetics / Technology)
- FDA/EMA/NMPA regulatory status
- Clinical trial data and outcomes
- GMP/ISO certifications
- Data privacy compliance (GDPR, PIPL, SOC2)
- Patent freedom-to-operate analysis

**Market & Commercial Due Diligence**
- Market size and growth trajectory
- Competitive landscape
- Customer / tenant analysis (concentration, retention)
- Pricing power and contract terms
- Pipeline and backlog

**HR / People Due Diligence**

**Foreign Investment Review** (cross-border)
- FIRB / OIO / CFIUS applicability
- Application timeline and conditions
- National interest / security test considerations

### Step 3: Status Tracking

For each item, track:

| Item | Workstream | Priority | Status | Owner | Due Date | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| Title search | Title & Land | P0 | Requested | | 2026-06-01 | Ordered via lawyer |
| QoE analysis | Financial | P0 | In Progress | | | Draft received, under review |

Status options: `Not Started → Requested → Received → In Review → Complete → Red Flag`

### Step 4: Red Flag Summary

Maintain a running list of red flags:
- What was found
- Which workstream
- Severity: **Deal-breaker** / **Significant** (affects terms) / **Manageable** (can be mitigated)
- Mitigant or path to resolution
- Impact on valuation or deal terms

### Step 5: Output

- Checklist tables per workstream with status tracking
- Summary dashboard: % complete by workstream, outstanding items, red flags
- Feed red flags into `risk-matrix`
- Feed outstanding items into `gap-tracking`

## Output Format

- **Chat**: Markdown — workstream progress summary + P0 outstanding items + red flags
- **KB update**: writes to the following Project Knowledge Base section(s) of `[AI] <项目名>_知识网络.html`:
  - 十 待确认问题清单
- **Section details**:
  - 十: 按工作流 (法律/财务/税务/商业/技术/环境/监管) 组织的 open-question 表；每项标注紧迫度、责任方、阻塞性
- All KB writes go through `knowledge-base-generation` (single source of truth — no separate layer/section HTML files).
- All output conforms to `../knowledge-base-generation/references/visual-style-guide.md`.
## Sector-Specific Additions

Automatically add relevant items based on sector:
- **Real Estate**: Title, planning controls, heritage, staging, infrastructure contributions, affordable housing obligations
- **Energy**: Grid connection, GPS review, AEMO registration, offtake/PPA, technology warranty
- **Biosynthetics**: Regulatory pathway, clinical data, IP, GMP certification, supply chain for feedstock
- **Technology**: Technical architecture, SOC2/security, product metrics, customer contracts, data privacy
- **Trade / Industrial**: Import/export licenses, 动检证, cold chain certification, occupancy/lease terms, environmental compliance

## Important Notes

- Prioritize P0 items that are gating to LOI or close.
- Flag items where the seller is slow to respond — may indicate issues.
- Cross-reference data room contents against the checklist to identify gaps.
- The checklist is a living document — update as diligence progresses.
- For cross-border deals, run parallel DD tracks for each jurisdiction.
